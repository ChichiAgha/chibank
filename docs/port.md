# Port developer portal

The Techbleat Global Bank catalog and self-service actions are managed from this repository and applied to the Port EU API by GitHub Actions.

## Catalog model

The catalog setup is defined in:

- `port/catalog/blueprints.json`
- `port/catalog/entities.json`
- `scripts/setup-port-catalog.sh`
- `.github/workflows/setup-port-catalog.yml`

The model contains six blueprints:

| Blueprint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `bankDomain` | Banking business domains |
| `bankApplication` | The overall banking application |
| `bankService` | Independently testable and deployable services |
| `bankResource` | Databases, caches, and message brokers |
| `bankEnvironment` | Development and production runtime environments |
| `bankDeployment` | Deployment history for a service and environment |

### Relationships

```text
Retail Banking domain
└── Techbleat Global Bank application
    ├── Banking Frontend
    │   └── depends on User, Transaction, and Activity services
    ├── User Service
    │   └── uses PostgreSQL
    ├── Transaction Service
    │   └── uses PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka
    ├── Activity Service
    │   ├── depends on Transaction Service
    │   └── uses PostgreSQL and Kafka
    ├── Development environment
    └── Production environment
```

The setup script is idempotent. Updating either catalog JSON file on `main` automatically reapplies the model and entities. It does not delete unrelated Port data.

Service entities expose their immutable container image, deployed version, Prometheus metrics path, and operations dashboard. Successful development rollouts are represented by `bankDeployment` entities related to both the service and the Minikube development environment. The catalog currently records the four verified `v1.1.0` deployments from 22 July 2026.

## Self-service actions

Self-service definitions are managed in:

- `port/self-service/actions.json`
- `scripts/setup-port-self-service.sh`
- `.github/workflows/setup-port-self-service.yml`

The following actions are available in Port:

| Action | Location | Approval | Backend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Run bank service tests | Each Bank Service entity | No | `run-bank-service-tests.yml` |
| Run bank image security scan | Self-service page | No | `image-scan.yaml` |
| Resync bank catalog | Self-service page | Yes | `setup-port-catalog.yml` |

The GitHub Ocean integration reports the dispatched workflow result back to the Port action run.

## Required GitHub Actions secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT_CLIENT_ID` | Port organization API client ID |
| `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Port organization API client secret |
| `PORT_GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub authentication for the Ocean exporter |

Secret values must remain in GitHub Actions secrets and must never be committed.

## Running setup manually

From GitHub, open **Actions** and run either:

1. **Setup Port Bank Catalog** to reapply blueprints, entities, and relationships.
2. **Setup Port Self-Service** to reapply the action definitions.

## Deployment actions

Production deployment, rollback, restart, and scaling actions are intentionally not exposed yet. The current development runtime is Minikube, which is not reachable from GitHub-hosted runners. Add a GitHub-accessible Kubernetes target or a self-hosted runner with a narrowly scoped service account before exposing these operations.

When that runtime connection exists, production actions should require approval and use environment-scoped credentials, while development actions should enforce bounded service and replica inputs.
